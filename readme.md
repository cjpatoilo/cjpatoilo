Hi there,

I‚Äôm CJ Patoilo and over the years I've contributed to the design and developer communities by creating free open source projects.

I love open source! ‚ù§Ô∏è

I actively maintain 70+ open source packages which are downloaded million times per month and [all my code is freely accessible on GitHub](https://github.com/cjpatoilo).

Here are some of the projects I maintain:

- [Milligram](https://milligram.io/): A minimalist CSS framework.
- [Airform](https://airform.io/): Functional HTML forms for Front-End Developers.
- [Chalkboard](https://chalkboard.space/): Share your code and collaborate with developers around the world.
- [Rasper](https://cjpatoilo.com/rasper/): Node.js parse argument options make ease.
- [BannerCLI](https://cjpatoilo.com/banner-cli/): Create a banner comment from package data.
- [Initify](https://cjpatoilo.com/initify/): A meaningful Open Source Boilerplate ‚Äì it's a piece of cake!
- [Marshmallow](https://cjpatoilo.com/marshmallow/): README Parser ‚Äì as easy as a marshmallow!

Who‚Äôs using my projects:

- [The Node.js Foundation](https://live.nodejs.org/): Kicking off a series of global events bringing together local Node.js developers around the world.
- [Phoenix Framework](https://phoenixframework.org/): A productive web framework that does not compromise speed or maintainability.
- [BEM](https://getbem.com/): Methodology that helps you to create reusable components.

If you or your company use any of my projects or like what I‚Äôm doing, please consider [sponsoring me](https://www.patreon.com/cjpatoilo/) so I can continue maintaining and evolving all my projects and new ones.

Thanks for the support! üôèüèª
